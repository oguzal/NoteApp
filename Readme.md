# Simple Note Application

This application allows users to easily manage their notes through  indexing, creation, update, and deletion functionalities.

### Modular Design

The application is built with a modular architecture, consisting of two independent projects:

### Backend Application: 
Handles data storage, processing, and business logic.

### Frontend Application: 
Provides the user interface for interacting with the backend.


<b>Each project has its own dedicated README file that outlines specific instructions for setup and execution.
Please refer to the respective README files for detailed guidance and start with the Backend Project first</b>
